# Dice
In this game you will roll 5 6-sided dice at once and collect points as you continue. Every 1 is worth 100 points, 5 is worth 50 points, and everything else is worth 0 points. If you don't roll any 1's or 5's the game ends.

# Instructions
*Make sure that you've installed Python 3.8.0 or higher and that it's running.
